Introduction
------------

E-mail notifications from [Slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com/) are rather brief and all the information is contained in the subject of the e-mail - the body is empty.

Slurm-Mail aims to address this by providing a drop in replacement for Slurm's e-mails to give users much more information about their jobs via HTML e-mails which contain the following information:

* Start/End
* Job name
* Partition
* Work dir
* Elapsed time
* Exit code
* Std out file path
* Std err file path
* No. of nodes used
* Node list
* Requested memory per node
* Maximum memory usage per node
* CPU efficiency
* Wallclock
* Wallclock accuracy

E-mails can be easily customised to your needs using the provided templates (see below).

You can also opt to include a number of lines from the end of the job's output files in the job completion e-mails (see below).

Installation
------------

> **_NOTE:_**  As of version 2.0 of Slurm-Mail the code is tested with Python 3 only and no assurance of backwards compatibility with Python 2 is given. The try/except clauses for common gotchas like `configparser` vs `ConfigParser` have now been removed.

Download the latest release of Slurm-Mail and unpack it to a directory of your choosing on the server(s) running the Slurm controller daemon `slurmctld`, e.g. `/opt/slurm-mail`

```bash
tar xfz slurm-mail-2.0.tar.gz
```

Create the spool and log directories for Slurm-Mail on your Slurm controller(s):

```bash
mkdir -p /var/spool/slurm-mail /var/log/slurm-mail
chown slurm. /var/spool/slurm-mail /var/log/slurm-mail
chmod 0700 /var/spool/slurm-mail /var/log/slurm-mail
```
Now edit `conf.d/slurm-mail.conf` to suit your needs. For example, check that the location of `sacct` is correct and set the log and spool directories to match those created in the previous step.

Change the value of `MailProg` in your `slurm.conf` file to `/opt/slurm-mail/bin/slurm-spool-mail.py`. By default the Slurm config file will be located at `/etc/slurm/slurm.conf`.

Restart `slurmctld`:

```bash
systemctl restart slurmctld
```

Slurm-Mail will now log e-mail requests from Slurm users to the Slurm-Mail spool directory.

Create a cron job to run `slurm-send-mail.py` periodically to send HTML e-mails to users. As Slurm-Mail uses `sacct` to gather additional job information and may perform additional processing, the sending of e-mails was split into a separate application to prevent adding any overhead to `slurmctld`.

Example cron job, e.g.`/etc/cron.d/slurm-mail`:

```
*    *    *    *    *    root    /opt/slurm-mail/bin/slurm-send-mail.py
```

SMTP Settings
-------------

By default Slurm-Mail will send e-mails to a mail server running on the same host as Slurm-Mail is installed on, i.e. `localhost`.

You can edit the `smtp` configuration options in `conf.d/slurm-mail.conf`. For example, to send e-mails via Gmail's SMTP server set the following settings:

```
smtpServer = smtp.gmail.com
smtpPort = 587
smtpUseTls = yes
smtpUserName = your_email@gmail.com
smtpPassword = your_gmail_password
```

> **_NOTE:_**  As this file will contain your Gmail password make sure that it has the correct owner, group and file access permissions.

For SMTP servers that use SSL rather than starttls please set `smtpUseSsl = yes`.

Customising E-mails
-------------------

Slurm-Mail uses Python's [string.Template](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#template-strings) class to create the e-mails it sends. Under Slurm-Mail's `conf.d` directory you will find the following files that you can edit to customise e-mails to your needs.

| Filename          | Purpose                                                       |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ended.tpl         | Template used for jobs that have finished.                    |
| ended-array.tpl   | Template used for jobs in an array that have finished.        |
| job_table.tpl     | Template used to create the job info table in e-mails.        |
| started.tpl       | Template used for jobs that have started.                     |
| started-array.tpl | Template used for the first job in an array that has started. |
| style.css         | Cascading style sheet (CSS) used by the e-mails.              |

To change the date/time format used for job start and end times in the e-mails, change the `datetimeFormat` configuration option in `conf.d/slurm-mail.conf`. The format string used is the same as Python's [datetime.strftime function](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#strftime-strptime-behavior).

To change the subject of the e-mails, change the `emailSubject` configuration option in `conf.d/slurm-mail.conf`. You use the following place holders in the string:

| Place holder | Value                   |
| ------------ | ----------------------- |
| $CLUSTER     | The name of the cluster |
| $JOB_ID      | The Slurm ID of the job |
| $STATE       | The state of the job    |

Including Job Output in E-mails
-------------------------------

In `conf.d/slurm-mail.conf` you can set the `includeOutputLines` to the number of lines to include from the end of each job's standard out and standard error files.

Notes:

* if the user has decided to use the same file for both standard output and standard error then there will be only one section of job output in the job completion e-mails.
* Job output can only be included if the process that is running `slurm-send-mail.py` is able to read the user's output files.
